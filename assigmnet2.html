        <p>Lalbagh Botanical Garden or simply Lalbagh,
             is an botanical garden in Bangalore, India, with an over 200-year history.
              First planned and laid out during the dalavaiship of Hyder Ali and later managed 
              under numerous British Superintendents before Indian Independence
              Hyder Ali commissioned the building of this garden in 1760 but his son, Tipu Sultan,
               completed it. A Bagh is Hindustani for garden while the reference of the prefix Lal 
               is debated and could refer to the colour red due to its original floral composition 
               but Lal also means "beloved". Hyder Ali decided to create this garden on the lines 
               of the Mughal Gardens that were gaining popularity during his time. Hyder Ali laid
                out these famous botanical gardens and his son Tipu Sultan added horticultural we
                alth to them by importing trees and plants from several countries. Hyder and Tipu's
                 Lalbagh gardens were managed by Mohammed Ali and his son Abdul Khader and were based 
                 on design of the Mughal Gardens that once stood at Sira, at a distance of 120 km from
                 Bangalore. At that time, Sira was the headquarters of the strategically important
                  southernmost Mughal "suba" (province) of the Deccan before the British Raj.[2]

              The Lalbagh gardens were commissioned by the 18th century and over the years
               it acquired India's first lawn-clock and the subcontinent's largest collection
                of rare plants.[3] After the British conquest of Kingdom of Mysore in 1799, the 
                garden was under the charge of Major Gilbert Waugh, Company paymaster and in 1814
                 its control was transferred to the Government of Mysore with an appeal by Waugh to
                  the Marquis of Hastings that it should be under the botanical garden at Fort William,
                  Calcutta. This was accepted and the charge for supervision was given to Nathaniel Wallich 
                   24 April 1819. This continued until 1831 when charge moved to the Mysore 
                   . An Agricultural and Horticultural Society had been formed with William Munro, an 
                   army officer and amateur botanist in charge of the Bangalore chapter.</p>
